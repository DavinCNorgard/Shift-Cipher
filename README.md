# Shift-Cipher
A shift cipher uses a basic encryption algorithm centered around the modulo opterator. This allows a person to hide a message, and only someone with the key and the algorithm will be able to decrypt the message 
The Python file contains three basic functions, decode(), encode(), and convert(). The convert function turns a list into a string. The other two functions decrypt and encrypt a string respectivly, and rely on a built in alphabet ([a-z],[A-Z],[0-9]). If the user eneters any characters not in the alphabet those characters will be ignored.
