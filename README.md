# Shift-Cipher
A shift cipher uses a basic encryption algorithm centered around the modulo operator. This allows a person to hide a message, and only someone with the key and the algorithm will be able to decrypt the message.
The Python file contains three basic functions, decode(), encode(), and convert(). The convert function turns a list into a string. The other two functions decrypt and encrypt a string respectevly, and rely on a built-in alphabet ([a-z],[A-Z],[0-9]). If the user eneters any characters not included in the alphabet those characters will be ignored.
